            Can I accumulate pulses, and activate the output after a desired
            number of pulses are received?

          <div class="faqblock-content">
            <p>
              No. The PCM control modules will output for a set number of
              seconds after every pulse is received. You will have to ensure
              that the flow rate combined with the flow meter's pulse rate is
              accounted for by ensuring the "on time" does not exceed the
              available time between pulses. If you do need to accumulate
              pulses, we recommend the SeaMetrics PT35 Pulse Timer. More
              information can be found on the PT35{" "}

              <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum ?</h2>
              <p>
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
                industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
                text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
                of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
                popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
                Lorem Ipsum.

              <h2>Why do we use it ?</h2>
              <p>
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted
                by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
                The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
                normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content
                here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
                desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem
                Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
                ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
                Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
                accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

              <h2>Wher we can it ?</h2>
              <p>
                There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,
                but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by
                injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
                slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem
                Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing
                hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on
                the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,
                making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a
                dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of
                model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
                reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free
                from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words
                etc.
